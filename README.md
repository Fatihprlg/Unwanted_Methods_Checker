# Unwanted Methods Checker
Checks if unwanted methods called anywhere in assembly for Unity. Used Jb Evain's MethodBaseRocks class for resolve methods.
# Usage
Put the script to an object on your scene and type your unwanted method names. Just use Methodname, dont whole call string (ex. **not** *DOTween.KillAll()* **do** *KillAll*).

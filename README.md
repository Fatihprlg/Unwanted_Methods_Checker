# Unwanted Methods Checker
Checks if unwanted methods called anywhere in assembly for Unity. Used Jb Evain's MethodBaseRocks class for resolve methods.
#Usage
Put the prefab on your scene and type your unwanted method names. Just use Methodname, dont whole call string (ex. #not DOTween.KillAll() #do KillAll).
